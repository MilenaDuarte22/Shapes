## Shapes Area Calculator - OOP 

## A short project applying the base conceppts of OOP Programming

* This Projects is an example of application OOP concepts in Java,the principles used was: inheritance, encapsulation, Instances, and polymorphism. In a clean and well-structured code, making good use of object-oriented principles, the Shapes Project is a area calculator for basic geometric forms. The user can choose a geometric form and insert the respective values for the selected form, with the values provided the program will calculate the respective area.

## Features

* Clean and well-structured code
* Object-oriented principles implementation
* Area calculation for various geometric shapes
* User-friendly 

## Code Structure

* The project consists of multiple Java classes representing different geometric shapes, each inheriting from a common `Shapes` abstract class. The `Main` class handles user input and form selection, while individual shape classes implement their specific logic for area calculation.

## Technologies used
